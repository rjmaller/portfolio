## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews](https://github.com/rjmaller/ECON628-01-rjmaller/blob/master/projects/NLP_Sentiment_Analysis_Movie_Reviews.ipynb): A predictive sentiment analysis model using natural language processing tools in Python to anticipate whether a movie review is positive or negative. Trained using a large body of text reviews culled from IMDB.
  
	- [The Titanic: Predicting a Binary Outcome Using a Classification Tree](https://github.com/rjmaller/portfolio/blob/master/Titanic%20Decision%20Tree%20Nov%2029.Rmd): A classification tree model using R to predict a binary outcome, determining which passengers were more likely to survive the sinking of the Titanic based on traits such as age, gender, and class.
  
	- [Web scraping using Beautiful Soup in Python](https://github.com/rjmaller/portfolio/blob/master/Web%20Scraping%20with%20Python%20-%20CS131A%20Webpage%20Data.ipynb): Creating a Python web scraper to collect text and hyperlink data from websites, save it as a CSV file and dataframe, and carry out textual analysis.
	
	_Tools: scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Beautiful Soup 4, NLTK

- ### Academic Works

	- [MS Economics Thesis: The Impact of Cleft Lip and Palate Repair Surgery on Cognitive and Academic Outcomes for Teens in India](https://github.com/rjmaller/portfolio/blob/master/R%20Jeremiah%20Maller%20-%20Impact%20of%20Cleft%20Lip%20and%20Palate%20Repair%20Surgery%20on%20Cognitive.pdf): A difference-in-differences regression estimation method is used to identify the causal impact of the surgical cleft repair intervention by comparing the life outcomes of teens that received the treatment to their nearest age (non-cleft) siblings. And in turn comparing this difference to the difference between teens with cleft who did not have access to the surgery at a young age and their own (non-cleft) siblings. The difference-in-differences method compares changes or differences in an untreated comparison group to changes or differences in a treatment group to construct a counterfactual estimate of how outcomes would have evolved in the absence of treatment.
